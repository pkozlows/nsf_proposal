My first research internship was with a spectroscopist, and many of my advanced classes were taught by his kind. I have gained a respect for the spectroscopy community; they use the theoretical chemistry that interests me to discover technologies driving the green energy transition. With my disability inhibiting me from doing experiments, I want to make advances on the computational side, striking up collaborations with them through my novel application of Green's functions in the Mori-Zwanzig theory in their field. As a byproduct of the proposed work, I will gain expertise in photovoltaic materials, which will prepare me to think from the policy perspective of how to efficiently bring solar energy to the consumer.
