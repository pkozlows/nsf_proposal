The proposed research will develop a computational implementation of the theoretical MZ framework. Much thought has been put into improving upon the $GW$ approximation; this will investigate a hitherto unexplored alternative with that potential to upend how MBPT is done for strongly correlated systems. This work will improve upon traditional ab initio core spectroscopy techniques, enabling the design of improved photovoltaic materials.
