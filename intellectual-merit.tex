During my time at Caltech, I wrote a publication describing my analysis of a newly-developed CCSD method for periodic systems in comparison with DFT, as applied to heterogeneous catalysis. In my senior thesis, I implemented $G_0W_0$ for molecules, with an analytic full frequency integration. In addition, I took a recent course where I learned to apply matrix product state ideas to, among others, implement the time evolution block decimation algorithm (TEBD). This combination of practical experience performing simulations on periodic systems with a theoretical background on $GW$ theory and quantum many-body physics has prepared me to think about alternative formulations to the $GW$ approximation with the MZ of open quantum systems in condensed matter. I will be doing this with Professor Joonho Lee, an expert in applying quantum chemistry to the condensed phase. In addition, I gave talks on my senior research (Caltech Senior Thesis and Goldwater Symposiums) and attended the BerkeleyGW conference, where I learned about the methodology developments that enable one to track excited state phenomena, such as excitons, in energy materials.
