	abstract = {We present algorithmic and implementation details for the fully self-consistent finite-temperature \$GW\$ method in Gaussian Bloch orbitals for solids. Our implementation is based on the finite-temperature Green's function formalism in which all equations are solved on the imaginary axis, without resorting to analytical continuation during the self-consistency. No quasiparticle approximation is employed and all matrix elements of the self-energy are explicitly evaluated. The method is tested by evaluating the band gaps of selected semiconductors and insulators. We show agreement with other, differently formulated finite-temperature sc\$GW\$ implementations when finite-size corrections and basis set errors are taken into account. By migrating computationally intensive calculations to GPUs, we obtain scalable results on large supercomputers with nearly optimal performance. Our work demonstrates the applicability of Gaussian orbital based sc\$GW\$ for \${\textbackslash}emph\{ab initio\}\$ correlated materials simulations and provides a sound starting point for embedding methods built on top of \$GW\$.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The pyrite and marcasite polymorphs of FeS$_{\textrm{2}}$ have attracted considerable interests for their potential applications in optoelectronic devices because of their appropriate electronic and optical properties. Controversies regarding their fundamental band gaps remain in both experimental and theoretical materials research of FeS$_{\textrm{2}}$. In this work, we present a systematic theoretical investigation into the electronic band structures of the two polymorphs by using many-body perturbation theory with the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GW{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} approximation implemented in the full-potential linearized augmented plane waves (FP-LAPW) framework. By comparing the quasi-particle (QP) band structures computed with the conventional LAPW basis and the one extended by high-energy local orbitals (HLOs), denoted as LAPW + HLOs, we find that one-shot or partially self-consistent {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GW{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}G{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{0}}${\textless}italic{\textgreater}W{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{0}}$ and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GW{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{0}}$, respectively) on top of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation with a converged LAPW + HLOs basis is able to remedy the artifact reported in the previous {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GW{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} calculations, and leads to overall good agreement with experiment for the fundamental band gaps of the two polymorphs. Density of states calculated from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}G{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{0}}${\textless}italic{\textgreater}W{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{0}}$@PBE with the converged LAPW + HLOs basis agrees well with the energy distribution curves from photo-electron spectroscopy for pyrite. We have also investigated the performances of several hybrid functionals, which were previously shown to be able to predict band gaps of many insulating systems with accuracy close or comparable to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GW{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. It is shown that the hybrid functionals considered in general fail badly to describe the band structures of FeS$_{\textrm{2}}$ polymorphs. This work indicates that accurate prediction of electronic band structure of FeS$_{\textrm{2}}$ poses a stringent test on state-of-the-art first-principles approaches, and the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}G{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{0}}${\textless}italic{\textgreater}W{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{0}}$ method based on semi-local approximation performs well for this difficult system if it is practiced with well-converged numerical accuracy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We tackle this challenge by proposing a double grid approach to {\textless}bold{\textgreater}k{\textless}/bold{\textgreater}-sampling compatible with the effective Lanczos-based Haydock iterative solution. Our method relies on a coarse {\textless}bold{\textgreater}k{\textless}/bold{\textgreater}-grid that drives the computational cost, while a dense {\textless}bold{\textgreater}k{\textless}/bold{\textgreater}-grid is responsible for capturing excitonic effects, albeit in an approximated way. Importantly, the fine {\textless}bold{\textgreater}k{\textless}/bold{\textgreater}-grid requires minimal extra computation due to the simplicity of our approach, which also makes the latter straightforward to implement. We performed tests on bulk Si, bulk GaAs and monolayer MoS$_{\textrm{2}}$, all of which produced spectra in good agreement with data reported elsewhere. This framework has the potential of enabling the calculation of optical spectra in semiconducting systems where the efficiency of the Haydock scheme alone is not enough to achieve a computationally tractable solution of the BSE, e.g., large-scale systems with very stringent {\textless}bold{\textgreater}k{\textless}/bold{\textgreater}-sampling requirements for achieving convergence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We present an efficient basis for imaginary time Green's functions based on a low rank decomposition of the spectral Lehmann representation. The basis functions are simply a set of well-chosen exponentials, so the corresponding expansion may be thought of as a discrete form of the Lehmann representation using an effective spectral density which is a sum of \${\textbackslash}delta\$ functions. The basis is determined only by an upper bound on the product \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}omega\_\{{\textbackslash}max\}\$, with \${\textbackslash}beta\$ the inverse temperature and \${\textbackslash}omega\_\{{\textbackslash}max\}\$ an energy cutoff, and a user-defined error tolerance \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$. The number \$r\$ of basis functions scales as \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}omega\_\{{\textbackslash}max\}) {\textbackslash}log (1/{\textbackslash}epsilon){\textbackslash}right)\$. The discrete Lehmann representation of a particular imaginary time Green's function can be recovered by interpolation at a set of \$r\$ imaginary time nodes. Both the basis functions and the interpolation nodes can be obtained rapidly using standard numerical linear algebra routines. Due to the simple form of the basis, the discrete Lehmann representation of a Green's function can be explicitly transformed to the Matsubara frequency domain, or obtained directly by interpolation on a Matsubara frequency grid. We benchmark the efficiency of the representation on simple cases, and with a high precision solution of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev equation at low temperature. We compare our approach with the related intermediate representation method, and introduce an improved algorithm to build the intermediate representation basis and a corresponding sampling grid.},

	abstract = {Diagrammatic perturbation theory is a powerful tool for the investigation of interacting many-body systems, the self-energy operator Σ encoding all the variety of scattering processes. In the simplest scenario of correlated electrons described by the ��⁢�� approximation for the electron self-energy, a particle transfers a part of its energy to neutral excitations. Higher-order (in screened Coulomb interaction ��) self-energy diagrams lead to improved electron spectral functions (SFs) by taking more complicated scattering channels into account and by adding corrections to lower order self-energy terms. However, they also may lead to unphysical negative spectral functions. The resolution of this difficulty has been demonstrated in our previous works. The main idea is to represent the self-energy operator in a Fermi golden rule form which leads to a manifestly positive definite SF and allows for a very efficient numerical algorithm. So far, the method has only been applied to the three-dimensional electron gas, which is a paradigmatic system, but a rather simple one. Here we systematically extend the method to two dimensions including realistic systems such as monolayer and bilayer graphene. We focus on one of the most important vertex function effects involving the exchange of two particles in the final state. We demonstrate that it should be evaluated with the proper screening and discuss its influence on the quasiparticle properties.},

Such a theory is particle and energy conserving in the sense of Kadanoff and Baym. We find an increase in the weight of the quasiparticle as compared to ordinary non-self-consistent calculations but also to calculations with partial self-consistency using a fixed ��. The quasiparticle bandwidth is larger than that of free electrons and the satellite structure is broad and featureless; both results clearly contradict the experimental evidence. The total energy, though, is as accurate as that from quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and its derivative with respect to particle number agrees with the Fermi energy as obtained directly from the pole of the Green’s function at the Fermi level. Our results indicate that, unless vertex corrections are included, non-self-consistent results are to be preferred for most properties except for the total energy.},

	abstract = {We introduce a combinatorial version Mori-Zwanzig theory and develop from it a family of self-consistent evolution equations for the correlation function or Green's function of interactive many-body systems. The core idea is to use an ansatz to rewrite the memory kernel (self-energy) of the regular Mori-Zwanzig equation as a function composition of the correlation (Green's) function. Then a series of algebraic combinatorial tools, especially the commutative and noncommutative Bell polynomials, are used to determine the exact Taylor series expansion of the composition function. The resulting combinatorial Mori-Zwanzig equation (CMZE) yields novel non-perturbative expansions of the equation of motion for the correlation (Green's) function. The structural equation for deriving such a combinatorial expansion resembles the combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equation and may be viewed as its temporal-domain analogue. After introducing the abstract word and tree representation of the CMZE, we show its wide-range application in classical, stochastic, and quantum many-body systems. In all these examples, the new self-consistent expansions we obtained with the CMZE are similar to the diagrammatic skeleton expansions used in quantum many-body theory and lattice statistical field theory. We expect such a new framework can be used to calculate the correlation (Green's) function for strongly correlated/interactive many-body systems.},
