\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Aim \arabic*}]
    \item The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a paradigmatic system in condensed matter physics. As part of my rotation project with Prof. Lee, I will implement fully self-consistent $GW$ (scGW) for the UEG. I am interested in whether I can corroborate the result reported in the literature \cite{holm_fully_1998}, where scGW predicts only one quasi-particle peak in the frequency spectrum, while highly accurate Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations show an additional satellite peak. Vertex corrections have been shown to address this issue within Hedin's framework.
    \item Perform a similar investigation on the UEG in the MZ framework. Assess improvements over $GW$. Of particular interest is how many terms for the perturbative expansion in the MZ framework need to be included to achieve a similar accuracy to $GW$ and what computational scaling does this come with.
    \item Apply the MZ framework to a realistic condensed matter system. The UEG is known to provide a good description of metallic systems, so the transition should be natural.
    \item During my project, I will be using various diagrammatic theories; I have a fine motor impairment resulting from a stroke, so this project will provide the motivation to improve my handwriting through practice. In addition, I will gain experience in how to typeset diagrams, both tree and Feynman, in \LaTeX.
